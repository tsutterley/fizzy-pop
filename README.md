# Fizzy-pop theme

Fizzy-Pop is a dark theme based on J Glovier's [Fizzy theme](https://github.com/jglovier/fizzy). Fizzy is a light syntax theme for [Atom](http://atom.io/) inspired by [Macrabbit Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/)'s default syntax highlighting color scheme, and by the [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) for Sublime.
Fizzy pop features bright, primary colors on a black background. It is a syntax theme only, and will not affect the Atom UI (it works with both the Light UI scheme, and Dark UI scheme).  Most of the colors are from the Fizzy theme, which I rearranged for use with a dark background.  Some colors are new.
